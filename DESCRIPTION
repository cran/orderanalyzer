Description: Functions for extracting text and tables from 
  PDF-based order documents. It provides an n-gram-based approach for identifying 
  the language of an order document. It furthermore uses R-package 'pdftools' to 
  extract the text from an order document. In the case that the PDF document is 
  only including an image (because it is scanned document), R package 'tesseract' 
  is used for OCR. Furthermore, the package provides functionality for identifying 
  and extracting order position tables in order documents based on a clustering approach.
